"""Deploy the GeoGuesser environment to the Hugging Face Hub.

Three artifacts, split by what each is good at:

    bucket   HuggingEnvs/geoguesser-panos   22 GB of imagery + both indexes
    dataset  HuggingEnvs/geoguesser-tasks    the indexes alone, versioned
    space    AdithyaSK/geoguesser-env        the running environment

Override the owners with GEOGUESSER_HF_ORG (Space and dataset) and
GEOGUESSER_HF_BUCKET_OWNER (bucket).

The bucket exists because Space disk is ephemeral and capped well below 22 GB,
and because buckets are mutable object storage rather than git. The dataset repo
exists because a bucket is *not* versioned: a frozen benchmark needs a place
where a change to it is visible in history. The Space mounts the bucket
read-only at /data, so the same image serves a local checkout and the Hub with
nothing but environment variables between them.

`openenv push` is deliberately not used: it cannot attach a bucket volume, and
its default excludes would upload 22 GB of panoramas into git.

Usage:
    export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
    python dataset/deploy_hub.py --all
    python dataset/deploy_hub.py --space          # code only, fast iteration
    python dataset/deploy_hub.py --verify         # check a live deployment

# GeoGuesser Task Splits

Task indexes for the [GeoGuesser OpenEnv environment](https://huggingface.co/spaces/{SPACE_ID}).
Each line is one episode: an ordered list of panorama frames with coordinates,
headings and capture dates, plus the sequence and contributor it came from.

| Split | Tasks | Countries | Frames | Fully mirrored |
|---|---|---|---|---|
{rows}

## What a task is

These files carry **metadata only**, not imagery. Every frame's coordinates,
heading and capture date are here, so the movement graph resolves with no
network access; only image bytes need fetching, and Mapillary's `thumb_*_url`
values are expiring signed CDN URLs that cannot be stored. Resolve them from
`image_id` through the Mapillary Graph API, or mirror them once with
`dataset/build_tasks.py` from the environment repository.

## How the split was made

Both splits are carved from one 3,673-task pool, so contamination is enforced
exactly once rather than reasoned about across two separate harvests. The rules
follow the OSV-5M paper, which built its train/test split from the same
Mapillary source:

- no shared `sequence_id` between splits
- no training task within **1 km** of an eval task

The buffer matters because frames sit about 3.3 m apart: holding out an image
while keeping its neighbour holds out nothing. The split script verifies its own
output and exits non-zero if either rule is violated.

Eval is carved first, balanced by country and capped at 4 tasks each, because at
a couple of hundred tasks the balance decides what the score means. An earlier
unbalanced attempt put 28% of the set in one country.

## Provenance

Imagery is from [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com), CC BY-SA 4.0. Each task
records its contributor in `attribution`, which the environment displays. Only
360-degree panoramas are included (`camera_type == "spherical"`; note that the
documented value `equirectangular` does not appear in practice).

Sequences were discovered by enumerating Mapillary's `mly1_public` vector tiles
at zoom 6, where the sequence layer carries `is_pano` — 1.2 million panorama
sequences worldwide. Candidates are sampled with weight proportional to local
image density raised to **-0.75**, the OSV-5M weighting, then capped per country
and per contributor: one contributor alone holds 8% of the pool.

## Reproducing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/OpenEnv
cd HuggingEnvs/03-geoguesser/env
export MAPILLARY_API_KEY_TRAIN="MLY|..."

python dataset/harvest_tiles.py                 # enumerate sequences worldwide
./dataset/build_dataset.sh                      # assemble and mirror tasks
python ../dataset/verify_offline.py tasks/pool_offline_5k.jsonl
python dataset/split_tasks.py tasks/pool_offline_5k.jsonl --eval 200
```

A rebuild will not reproduce these exact tasks — the pool is sampled and
upstream coverage changes — which is precisely why the split is published rather
than left to be regenerated.
