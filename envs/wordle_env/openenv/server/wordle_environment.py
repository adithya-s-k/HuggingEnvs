Wordle MCP Environment.

Exposes 3 tools via FastMCP on MCPEnvironment:
  1. guess        — submit a 5-letter word guess
  2. get_history  — view all previous guesses and feedback
  3. reset_game   — start a new game with a random word

Each episode (reset → guess* → [reset]) maps to one WordleGame instance.
