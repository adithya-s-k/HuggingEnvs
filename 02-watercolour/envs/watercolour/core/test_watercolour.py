"""Tests for the watercolour environment.

Nothing here touches the network. The vision judge is exercised through a stub
client, which is also the only way to test the paths that matter most: a judge
that raises, and a judge whose two presentation orders disagree.

The tests that need a browser are marked and skipped when Playwright has no
Chromium installed, so the source, judging and reward logic stays testable
without a 100MB download.
