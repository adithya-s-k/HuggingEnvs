# Two deliberate departures from the layout in CONTRIBUTING.md, both forced by the
# same thing: this folder is called `openenv` and so is the installed package.
#
# 1. There is no `__init__.py` here. With one, `import openenv` resolves to this
#    folder whenever the interpreter's working directory is the environment root,
#    which is what the Dockerfile sets, and `openenv.core` then does not exist.
# 2. The path entry is appended rather than inserted, and points at the folder
#    holding `core/`, so an installed package always wins over a local directory.
