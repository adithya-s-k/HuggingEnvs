"""Reward composition for the watercolour environment.

The children are thin readers: the work happens once in
[`~envs.watercolour_env.server.scoring.evaluate_submission`], which hangs its
results on the observation. Composing them therefore costs nothing and the tree
stays introspectable via `env.rubric.named_rubrics()`.

The weights are the ones from the final rubric in Narreddi's write-up, and they
live in [`~envs.watercolour_env.server.scoring`], the same place the
observation's own reward reads them from, so the two cannot disagree.

HPSv3's 0.30 is carried by [`CoverageInBand`], for the reasons in
[`~envs.watercolour_env.server.scoring`]. It previously sat here as a child that
always returned zero, and this tree is the one that matters: it produces the
reward on the observation, which is the number a trainer optimises. Adding the
coverage term to `scoring` alone left the two paths disagreeing by 0.30 on the
same submission, with the feedback string reporting a reward the policy was never
given. The claim below that they cannot disagree is only true while every term
lives in both, so a new term goes in both or in neither.

See RFC 004 for the rubric design: `rfcs/004-rubrics.md`.
