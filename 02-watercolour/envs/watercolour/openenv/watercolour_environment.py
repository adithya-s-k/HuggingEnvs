"""The watercolour environment.

One episode is one painting. `reset()` names a subject and returns the prompt
along with the API reference the model needs, `step()` paints the submitted
sketch and judges it against the reference pool, and the episode ends.

Keeping episodes to a single exchange is deliberate. What is being measured is
whether a model can write code that paints well without ever seeing the result,
and letting it look and retry would measure something else.

        subject (`str`, *optional*):
            Fix the subject instead of sampling one, which is what a
            leaderboard run wants: without it every reset draws a fresh subject
            and two models are never asked the same question.
        domain (`str`, *optional*):
            Which painting subject to serve, `"hibiscus"` or `"jellyfish"`.
            Defaults to the hibiscus task, which reproduces Narreddi's. The
            domain carries its own subjects, composition guidance, judge criteria
            and reference pool; everything else is shared.
        scorer ([`QualityScorer`], *optional*):
            Absolute scorer for the dense term. Built alongside the judge when
            omitted, and left out when a judge is injected.
        judge ([`PairwiseJudge`], *optional*):
            Comparative scorer. When omitted and `enable_judge` is `True`, one
            is built from a Hugging Face Inference Providers token if the
            ambient environment supplies one.
        enable_judge (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Set `False` to score on gate admission alone, with no vision calls.
        references (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `2`):
            How many references each painting is compared against. Cost is two
            vision calls per reference, since every comparison runs in both
            presentation orders.
        return_image (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Include the painting in the observation as base64. Useful for
            building a gallery, wasteful during training.

    ```python
    env = WatercolourEnvironment(subject="two ripe plums")
